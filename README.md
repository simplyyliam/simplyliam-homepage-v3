# 🖥️ Liam Matthews — Portfolio

Welcome to my digital desk.  
This portfolio showcases who I am, what I create, and the way I think.

## ✨ About Me

I’m a creative front-end developer who loves crafting smooth, interactive experiences.  
I specialize in bringing motion and emotion into user interfaces using tools like:

- **React** & **TypeScript**
- **TailwindCSS** (v4)
- **GSAP** & **Three.js**
- Clean design systems with **glassmorphism** and **shadow play**

I’m currently building fun concepts like `Dymensh`, `GlassyBird`, `Weegit`, and `Foqusly` ,  
while constantly exploring new ways to blend UI/UX with subtle storytelling.

## 🧠 Philosophy

> "Design should feel like music — minimal, structured, and alive."  

This portfolio isn’t just a showcase; it’s a living space that grows with me.
Believe it or not, this is already the 8th iteration, and I’m not stopping here.

With every redesign, I get that joyful feeling, the kind that reminds me
I’m not just learning this stuff, I’m living it.
Each version brings me closer to becoming the developer I brand myself as.
I believe in building interfaces that feel **natural**, **fluid**, and **thoughtful** — like art with logic behind it.
I’m not a professional, I’m just someone who loves what they craft,
and lives it out with a bang.
